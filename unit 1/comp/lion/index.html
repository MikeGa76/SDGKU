        <h1>What is a pride of Lions?</h1>
        <p>Lions live in social groups much like families, and like a family it has structures. And that structure can differ between African and Asian subspecies. Lion prides on average consist of about three males and a dozen females, as well as their young. The females in a pride form the core of a pride, typically do not leave the pride from birth to death. </p>

        <h1>Male lions and pride behavior</h1>
        <p>a male cub remains in a pride for about three years, before the grown male lions push them out of the pride, where they become wandering nomads, for a few years typically about 2-4 years in which they sharpen their own skills. Then attempt to either aggressively claim a pride or form they form their own pride. </p>
